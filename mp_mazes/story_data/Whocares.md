I mean what billionaires aren’t a bit eccentric right? You had kinda faded out along the trip when you finally stopped drooling over sleeping(?) Elon. A guard slaps you across the face and pulls you out of the car. You step out into what appears to be an expansive, barren desert. This is a bit of a weird spot isn’t it, you think. Elon stares at you with a mysterious blank stare. “Most of them will never understand,” Elon exclaims, “but I have faith you can help me with my grand project.” He motions to an X shape strewn in the sand composed of a dark, matted residue. Blood?, you wonder. “Step forward, won’t you”, Elon says. Hmm, what to do?
# X
I mean, why not I guess?

# Nothanks
This is just too weird.
