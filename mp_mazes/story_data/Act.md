Elon is at HQ in order to look for a new employee to mentor. He looks around at all the new employees and points at you. You! You can't believe it this can't be happening! He motions to his guards to take you to his limo and he meets you inside. "It is pleasing to meet you, youngling, we have much to discuss." Well, didn't know he talked like that in real life, but you brush it aside. 4 hours later you arrive at your destination. You wanted to talk to him along the way but you think he was sleeping after he told called you youngling. At least that’s what it seemed like but he had his eyes open the whole time… Should you question this?
