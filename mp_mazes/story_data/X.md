"Thank you. You will be perfect.", Elon says with a wry smile. As you step onto the X, you feel every molecule in your body separating in excruciating pain. An instant later you feel yourself coming back. You open your eyes to a new landscape. You appear to be on some sort of alien spacecraft. A hideous being stumbles toward you. It looks like a fleshy pile of slime about the size of a small minivan. It speaks with gargled speech, “Do not be afraid little one, I have chosen you as my beloved. It is I, Elon. Will you be my companion in my quest to rule the galaxy?”

# Pacifist
Uh, no I’m not really into that sorta thing.
