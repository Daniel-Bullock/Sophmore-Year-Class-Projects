It's your first day working at the Tesla headquarters in Palo Alto. You spent your whole life idolizing the CEO Elon Musk, a man you could only dream of being half as brilliant as. You spent countless hours enhancing your computer science skills so that Tesla would be foolish to not hire you. As you walk through the big glass doors you can’t resist the big grin spreading across your face. What you didn’t expect was to see the man himself gracing the office with his presence, mere feet from your face.

What do you do?

# Hug
Bum rush him with a bear hug.
# Scream
Scream with childish excitement!
# Act
Keep your cool and hear what he has to say.
